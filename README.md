# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-TensorFlow-MNIST-Dataset-
This project demonstrates how to recognize handwritten digits using a neural network built with TensorFlow and trained on the MNIST dataset. It includes model training, evaluation, and prediction on external images. Ideal for beginners learning machine learning and deep learning concepts.

## Features
- Trained with 60,000 MNIST images
- Achieves > 97% test accuracy
- Accepts external JPG images for digit prediction

## Tech Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Pillow)

## Dataset

The dataset used here is the MNIST Dataset in JPG format, originally created and shared by [teavanist](https://github.com/teavanist/MNIST-JPG).
